Teaching- Creating lessons specific to the individual that would enable them to overcome their weaknesses, and improve the overall quality of their life. \nServing- Whether serving food at a soup kitchen, or cleaning someones gutters, I helped improve the community anyway I could. \nDistrict Leader- I was put in charge of 15 other missionaries to help with their duties to the community. I did this by keeping regular/daily communication with each of them, and holding weekly meetings to provide motivation and understanding to our purpose. \nAccomplishments Most notably: I helped one man quit smoking 5-6 packs of cigarettes a day, to zero. I helped another get the courage to go to rehab and finally give up alcohol. I helped another realize how important their life was, and not end it. Skills Used Charity, humility, diligence, perseverance, preparation, honesty. Ability to adapt to quickly changing circumstances.

Skills Used Self-discipline, I rarely had a supervisor on duty, so I had to manage my time and efforts to the best of my ability. Planning- I never knew when I would be asked to help up front, or when a shipment would arrive, so I had to make sure the shelves were in order at any given moment.
